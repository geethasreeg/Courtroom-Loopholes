I built a web-game using HTML, CSS and JS (node.js as well). I generates a 'crime' and provides the statement fo either the witness or the defendant. The player must identify the loophole in the statement using a list of options. (still-building)

Stay-tuned, I'm building this for HC Arcade game jam. I'll finish in a few days : )
